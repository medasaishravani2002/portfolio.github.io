    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
        <ul><li><b>CSE Question Bank Application using Java</b>
        <p>In the realm of modern education, the lack of a convenient platform for college students to access subjectspecific study materials poses a significant challenge. To tackle this, our project introduces an Android-based 
            Question Bank App developed using Java. This innovative solution offers an intuitive interface, granting 
            students effortless access to curated question banks aligned with their semesters. By synergizing Android's 
            versatility and Java's power, the app bridges the gap between education and technology, enhancing learning 
            experiences and academic progress.</p></li>
        <li><b>Implementation of plant protection system and Agri-field monitoring Using IoT</b>
        <p>This project is about that we suggest a method for analysing and identifying paddy illnesses and choosing 
            fertilizers that is computationally efficient. For classification, diagnosis, and treatment, this suggested system 
            makes use of a number of image processing principles, including image acquisition, image preprocessing, 
            feature extraction, and training convolutional neural networks. Additionally, we intend to create a Smart 
            Farming System using IoT technology that will enable farmers to access real-time data via a mobile app. Farmers 
            will be able to make decisions about their crops based on the system's real-time information on temperature, 
            humidity, and water levels.
